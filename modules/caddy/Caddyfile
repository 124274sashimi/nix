# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile


# The configuration below serves a welcome page over HTTP on port 80.  To use
# your own domain name with automatic HTTPS, ensure your A/AAAA DNS record is
# pointing to this machine's public IP, then replace `http://` with your domain
# name.  Refer to the documentation for full instructions on the address
# specification.
